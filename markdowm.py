# 📄 **Document QA Bot: A RAG-Based Application for Interactive Document Querying**

Welcome to the Document QA Bot, a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that utilizes **LlamaIndex** and **Hugging Face** models to answer questions based on documents you upload. This bot is designed to empower you with rapid, insightful responses, providing a choice of language models (LLMs) and embedding models that cater to various requirements, including performance, accuracy, and response time.

## ✨ **Application Overview**
With Document QA Bot, you can interactively query your document, receive contextual answers, and dynamically switch between LLMs as needed for optimal results. The bot supports various file formats, allowing you to upload and analyze different types of documents and even some image formats. 

### **Key Features**
- **Choice of Models:** Access a list of powerful LLMs and embedding models for optimal results.
- **Flexible Document Support:** Multiple file types supported, including images.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Easily switch between models for experimentation and fine-tuning answers.
- **User-Friendly:** Seamless experience powered by Gradio's intuitive interface.

## 🚀 **Steps to Use the Document QA Bot**

1. **Upload Your File**  
   Begin by uploading a document. Supported formats include `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.html`, `.jpg`, `.png`, and more.
   
2. **Select Embedding Model**  
   Choose an embedding model to parse and index the document’s contents, then submit. Wait for the confirmation message that the document has been successfully indexed.

3. **Choose a Language Model (LLM)**  
   Pick an LLM from the dropdown to tailor the bot’s response style and accuracy.

4. **Start Chatting**  
   Ask questions about your document! You can switch between LLMs as needed for different insights or to test model behavior on the same question.

## ⚙️ **How the Application Works**

Upon uploading a document, the bot utilizes **LlamaParse** to parse its content. The parsed data is then indexed with a selected embedding model, generating a vector representation that enables quick and relevant responses. When you ask questions, the chosen LLM interprets the document context to generate responses specific to the content uploaded.
